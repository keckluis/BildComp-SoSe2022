# BildComp SoSe 2022 - Assignment #03 - Depth map

## Task
Implement a script with Python and OpenCV that computes a depth map from at least three images. Write a readme file that explains what you have done and how to run the script and what the script does.


## Hints
Andreas Jakl has written a [great article series](https://www.andreasjakl.com/easily-create-depth-maps-with-smartphone-ar-part-1/) that provides code snippets and ideas that can be used.

You have to use your own images.

Check out [this project](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) to get an impression about a good readme file.

## Rating
- Write a script that finds matching feature points (1 point)
- Write a script that rectifies the images (pairwise). (2 points)
- Write a script that computes depth maps from two images. (2 points)
- Write a script that combines several depth maps (2 points) 
- BONUS: Implement a plane sweep algorithm (2 points)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented. And it can be well explained in the consultation. (up to 2 points)
- Readme is well written and helpful. It contains all used modules and their version. (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py files), accompanying images or videos and short explanation (readme.md file) either as one zip file or as a link to a public github respository via FELIX. If you use a Github link, please create a tag of the final version before the deadline.
- The reamde file should be no longer than 600 words, it can be German or English.
- The code is written mainly on your own and any other source is mentioned in the code. If two groups hand in the same or extremely similar solution, both groups do not pass the assignment.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
